key logic

define f.u.c.k.y.o.u. ids as clickable elements

create a function for keeping record of ids that are "clicked"
	store an array of letters clicked in the proper order
	if letter is clicked out of order: reset array back to empty



Every time someone clicks a letter, 
add it to the array and check to see if itâ€™s complete, 
incomplete, or out of order


If out of order, reset list, if I complete, do nothing


order the onclick to only alert when the ids are clicked in order
